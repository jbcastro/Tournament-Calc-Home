# Tournament-Calc-Home
Home repo for all different repos associated with the tournament calculator 

This app is for poker players to get an idea of how "good" a tournament is. If a player buys into a poker tournament and never shows up, the game is still dealt as if that player were  in their seat, i.e. the dealer will give them cards (which are immediately folded) and will still take their blinds and antes. This app has 2 parts, 1) a calculator that shows how long until a player is out of chips if they buy into a tournament and never show up (the longer the better) and 2) a database with all the casinos and regular tournaments with said grades. 

There are 4 repos to the app, 2 front end and 2 back ends, each relating to each other. The first is for adding casinos to a DB
Backend -> https://github.com/jbcastro/addcasino and frontend -> https://github.com/jbcastro/casino_front
Quick Demo here https://add-casino-demo.herokuapp.com/

The second is for adding tournaments for each casino which features the calculator
Backend-> https://github.com/jbcastro/tourncalc and frontend -> https://github.com/jbcastro/tournament_calculator_react


As of 12/12/20 the app is just being set up for people to enter casino and tournament data. Once more data is entered I plan on making a site to display everything from the database including grades for all tournaments, a way for user submitted tournaments at different casinos, and the standalone calculator.
